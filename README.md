Files to automate the deploy of letsencrypt certificates to gitlab

You will probably find these files usefull when you want to move your self-signed gitlab certificate to the [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)-signed one and automate the renewal of the certificate.

 - Start with `obtain-and-deploy-letsencrypt-cert.sh`, it is a pretty well commented shell script.
 - Feel free to inspire with the `crontab` file and *notifications*.
 - Enjoy **open-source** and **encryption**!
